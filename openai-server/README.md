OpenAI Integration

Generate AI-powered travel plans using OpenAI's GPT 3.5. It runs alongside our main Java backend. Created a separate program with Express to make it more simple and streamlined. Note that each team member needs their own API Key

Setup Instructions:

1. First

- An OpenAI key (https://platform.openai.com/)
- Front-end and Backend running

2. Installation

- cd openai-server
- npm install
- npm install express
- npm install cors
- npm install openai
- npm install axios

3.  OpenAI API Key Setup

- Login to (https://platform.openai.com/)
- Add payment information (required for access, can set small limit and require approval to add more)
- Get API key and save somewhere secure - OpenAI only shows it one time
- Replace the API key in server.js
- ** BEFORE PUSHING TO GITHUB MAKE SURE TO ERASE KEY AND ADD BACK 'YOUR-API-KEY-HHERE' **

4.  Running the Express Server

- In the terminal: node server.js
- You should see "Server running on port 3001"

5.  Generating Trips

- In a separate terminal run the front-end in Vite and input the trip info. The generated trip will show the JSON output in the node.js terminal

6.  Next Steps:

- Frontend Display: Show loading; display travel plan
  - Update From submission: point form to Spring backend instead of OpenAI server
  - Display travel plan: include info from wireframe
- Backend:
  - POST /api/trips to:
    - check if trip exists (simple)
    - call OpenAI, if needed
    - save to database, if needed
    - return trip
